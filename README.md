# zk-rollup-demo
This repository contains code for workshop on ZK rollups for the SPACE 2022 conference. We illustrate a toy, but an end to end
zk rollup system, using a local [ganache blockchain](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/). The workshop illustrates:
- Writing circuits for zero knowledge proofs using [circom](https://github.com/iden3/circom).
- Generating and verifying proofs for above circuits.
- Expressing the state update of rollup chain as a circuit.
- Verifying the proof of state update in a smart contract.
